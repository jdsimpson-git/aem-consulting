# Dark Theme Aesthetic

## Palette
- Base: navy 900 `#0a192f` for the page canvas; navy 800 `#112240` for secondary panels and accents.
- Accent: gold 400 `#d4af37` as the primary highlight on logos, buttons, and key phrases; gold 500 `#c5a028` for deeper accent moments.
- Neutrals: soft grays (`#f9fafb`, `#f3f4f6`) and semi-transparent whites (`/5`, `/10`, `/20`) to create readable text and glassy overlays on the dark base.
- Text: white and gray-300/400 copy on dark navy; selection state flips to gold background with navy text for emphasis.

## Typography
- Headings: Playfair Display serif for an elegant, editorial voice on titles and hero headlines.
- Body: Inter sans for clean readability across paragraphs and UI chrome.
- Microcopy: uppercase, tight, wide-tracked labels (e.g., nav links, section tags) to reinforce a premium, structured feel.

## Surface & Depth
- Glassmorphism: frequent use of `bg-white/5` + `border-white/10` with backdrop blur to create frosted cards over the navy canvas.
- Layered light: blurred radial blobs in gold and navy add glow and depth behind cards (hero, child wealth, CTAs).
- Edges: rounded-2xl corners, fine borders, and soft shadows (`shadow-2xl`) signal polish without breaking the dark-on-dark harmony.

## Interaction & Motion
- Motion: framer-motion drives gentle fades, slides, and hover lifts to keep the experience lively without harsh movement.
- Buttons: primary uses solid gold with navy text and uppercase tracking; secondary is outlined in white/gold with subtle hover fills.
- Icons: lucide icons in gold 400 sit inside small, rounded containers to keep the visual language consistent.

## Section Notes
- Navbar: translucent dark backdrop that solidifies on scroll; gold hover states on links and CTAs.
- Hero: oversized serif headline with gold italic emphasis; glass info card floating over blurred navy/gold glows.
- Features: three frosted cards with gold icons and hover outlines, sitting on the navy base.
- Child Wealth: angled navy overlay on the right and a deep navy card stack with gold metrics to underscore growth.
- Health Protection: navy-900 cards on a navy-800 stage, gold iconography, and subtle background icon etching for texture.
- About: navy panel with gold framing lines, serif hero text, and a gold-accented portrait placeholder.

## Overall Mood
Luxury-first financial security: dark navy grounds trust, gold signals prosperity, and the glassy layers plus serif headlines create a high-end advisory feel anchored by the mantra “Security is the New Luxury.”
